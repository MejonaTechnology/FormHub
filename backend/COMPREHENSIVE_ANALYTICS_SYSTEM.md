## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### Services Architecture

```go
// Core Analytics Services
analyticsService := NewAnalyticsService(db, redis)
submissionLifecycleService := NewSubmissionLifecycleService(db, redis, analyticsService)
geoIPService := NewGeoIPService(db, redis, apiKey)
abTestingService := NewABTestingService(db, redis, analyticsService)
cacheService := NewCacheService(redis)
realTimeService := NewRealTimeService(db, redis, analyticsService)
monitoringService := NewMonitoringService(db, redis, analyticsService, realTimeService)
reportingService := NewReportingService(db, redis, analyticsService, emailService, geoIPService)
```

### Event Tracking

**Client-Side Integration:**
```javascript
// Track form events
fetch('/api/v1/analytics/events', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    form_id: 'form-uuid',
    session_id: 'session-uuid', 
    event_type: 'form_view',
    page_url: window.location.href,
    utm_data: {
      source: 'google',
      medium: 'cpc',
      campaign: 'summer-sale'
    }
  })
});
```

**Server-Side Integration:**
```go
// Record analytics event
event := &models.FormAnalyticsEvent{
    FormID:    formID,
    UserID:    userID,
    SessionID: sessionID,
    EventType: models.EventTypeFormSubmit,
    IPAddress: clientIP,
    // ... additional fields
}

err := analyticsService.RecordEvent(ctx, event)
```

### Database Optimization

**Indexing Strategy:**
```sql
-- Performance indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_form_analytics_events_form_id ON form_analytics_events(form_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_form_analytics_events_created_at ON form_analytics_events(created_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_form_analytics_events_session_id ON form_analytics_events(session_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_submissions_form_id ON submissions(form_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_submissions_created_at ON submissions(created_at);

-- Composite indexes for complex queries
CREATE INDEX idx_analytics_form_date ON form_analytics_events(form_id, created_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_geographic_analytics_compound ON form_geographic_analytics(user_id, date, country_code);
```

**Data Partitioning:**
- Time-based partitioning for analytics events
- Automated archival of old data
- Optimized aggregation queries
